# EXCITE Summer School Zurich, 2023 - Full Day Practical Session 
## Medical Image Classification and Segmentation with Deep Learning ü´Å

This Repository contains material for the practical session on deep learning for medical image analysis.

Exercises are contained in `excite_FINAL.ipynb` and should be solved according to our schedule (see slides).

    0) Introduction to PyTorch
    1) Preparing the Data
    2) Model 1 - Fully Connected Network (FCN/MLP)
    3) Model 2 - Simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    4) Model 3 - Deep Residual Neural Network (ResNet)
    5) Interpretability of Predictions

In addition, we also provide you with the solutions to our tasks in `solution_for_excite_FINAL.ipynb`. These solutions are meant for students with no prior exposure to Python and should be referred to solely in the case you feel extremely overwhelmed. 

We would like to remind you to please ask whenever you have any questions or would like to discuss certain parts of the exercises! This is crucial in order to maximize your learning outcome.
Please note that the last exercise on interpretability is optional and meant for students with prior experience. So, please do not worry if you are having trouble understanding these exercises.

Enjoy!
